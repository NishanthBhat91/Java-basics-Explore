# Hello World in Java

This is a simple Java program that prints `"Hello, World!"` to the console. It serves as an introduction to Java programming.

## Concepts Covered
- Java package and class structure
- The `main` method as an entry point
- Printing output to the console using `System.out.println`

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the program:
   ```sh
   javac Main.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled class:
   ```sh
   java com.helloworld.Main
   ```
4. Expected Output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```
	
## Additional Notes

- The `System.out.println` statement prints text followed by a new line.
- The `main` method is where program execution starts.
